In the summer of 2022, for my thesis in Computer Science at Bishop's University, Quebec, Canada, I continued the development of an aquatic drone. 

Using machine learning, it can recognize a growing number of aquatic plants and will be able to map them in real-time. 

These are growing sets of code to achieve this. 

Using dronekit-python and python-gphoto, a raspberry pi controls a dslr camera and a navigator (the CubePilot). 

I am still developping the tensorflow-tensorflow_lite models and will upload them once they are satisfactory.

In Useful/ are tons of notes.

In Parameters/, you can find parameters and settings for the camera and the navigator.
